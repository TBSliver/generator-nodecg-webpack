# generator-nodecg-webpack

Yeoman generator for creating webpack based [NodeCG](https://nodecg.dev) bundles.

This is a basic setup, so familiarisation with webpack would be recommended.

## Getting Started

After installing NodeCG, install this generator and Yeoman, and use it to create a new bundle!

```shell
npm install -g yo @tbsliver/generator-nodecg-webpack
cd bundles
mkdir my-awesome-bundle
cd my-awesome-bundle
yo nodecg-webpack
```

Answer the questions, and then you can start developing your bundle by running:

```shell
npm run start
```

## Support

For technical issues with the generator, please open a new issue on this repository and I'l get back to you when I can.
